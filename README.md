# Dynamic Clock App
A new design challenge from Frontend Mentor Pro, built with Svelte/Vite ðŸ’œ

## The Challenge

- Responsive app layout
- Current time and location information based on user IP address
- More information is shown about the date and time in the expanded state
- App greeting and background image based on the time of day of the user
- Random programming quotes generated by clicking the quote refresh icon

## Tools Used

This app uses the following APIs:

- [World Time API](http://worldtimeapi.org/)
- [IP Geo Location API](https://rapidapi.com/natkapral/api/ip-geo-location)
- [Famous Quotes API](https://rapidapi.com/saicoder/api/famous-quotes4)

As well as these ever useful libraries:

- [Day.js](https://day.js.org/en/)
- [Svelte Legos](https://sveltelegos.com/) (that handy-dandy window size store)

With a shoutout to [Icons8](https://icons8.com/icon/65324/clock) for the clock favicon.
