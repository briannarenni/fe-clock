# Clock app (Frontend Mentor challenge)

## The challenge

A clock app using the following APIs:

- [World Time API](http://worldtimeapi.org/) to set the time based on the visitor's IP adress. This API will also be used for additional data, like the day of the year shown in the expanded state.
- [IP Geolocation API](https://freegeoip.app/) to set the city and country underneath the time
- [Programming Quotes API](https://programming-quotes-api.herokuapp.com/) to generate random programming quotes.
    - If the Programming Quotes API doesn't work, [here's a good alternative quote API](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable) you can use instead. It's not programming specific, but it will do the trick.

## App features

- Responsive app layout
- Current time and location information based on user IP address
- More information is shown about the date and time in the expanded state
- App greeting and background image based on the time of day of the user
- Random programming quotes generated by clicking the quote refresh icon
