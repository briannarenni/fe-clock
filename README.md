# Dynamic Clock App
A new challenge from Frontend Mentor Pro, built with SvelteJS & Vite and deployed with Netlify.

## The Challenge ‚úÖ

- Fully responsive app layout
- The app's greeting and background image are based on the user's current time of day
- Time & geo information is based on the user's IP address (pulled from [World Time API](http://worldtimeapi.org/) and  [IP Geo Location API](https://rapidapi.com/natkapral/api/ip-geo-location))
- Extra info is available in an extendable drawer
- Random programming quotes are pulled from the [Famous Quotes API](https://rapidapi.com/saicoder/api/famous-quotes4) (and a new quote can be loaded)

## Tool Shoutouts üíú

Grateful as always to these ever-useful libraries:

- [Ky](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ky)
- [Svelte Legos](https://sveltelegos.com/) (that handy-dandy window size store)
- [Icons8](https://icons8.com/icon/65324/clock) (the clock favicon üòè)

## Dev Notes
I finally got to dig into Svelte stores (Svelte 4 at least) a bit deeper than the last project, and I'm feeling solidifed now! This is my favorite framework right now, and though I'm excited to try Vue out, Svelte lives right up to its name for me.
